### 1. Why Data Structures & Algorithms Are Essential in Inventory Systems

###  Core Requirements:

* **Efficiency**
  Inventory systems managing 100K+ items need operations like add, update, and delete to execute in **O(1) or O(log n)** time.
  For example, using a `HashMap` allows constant-time (`O(1)`) lookup by `productID`.

* **Organization**
  Multiple data access patterns are essential:

  * `HashMap` → for quick access by ID
  * `TreeMap` → for sorted access (e.g., by category or price)
  * `PriorityQueue` → for tasks like low-stock alerts

* **Search Performance**
  Searching linearly (`O(n)`) becomes inefficient with large datasets.
  Indexed structures like `HashMap` (ID), or even a `Trie` (for product names), drastically reduce search time.

* **Memory and Scalability**
  While `ArrayList` is memory-efficient, it’s unsuitable for fast search operations.
  Systems handling over 1 million items benefit from external databases like **PostgreSQL** with proper indexing.

## 2. Best Data Structures for Inventory Use Cases

| **Structure**       | **Time Complexity** | **Use Case**                      | **Pros & Cons**                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `HashMap`           | O(1) (avg)          | Product lookup by ID              | Very fast; not sorted; risk of collisions |
| `TreeMap`           | O(log n)            | Sorted access (e.g., price order) | Keeps entries sorted; slower than HashMap |
| `ArrayList`         | O(n) search         | Basic storage, iteration          | Simple; poor search for large data        |
| `ConcurrentHashMap` | O(1) (avg)          | Multi-threaded environments       | Thread-safe; higher memory usage          |

##  3. Time Complexity Analysis Using `HashMap`

| **Operation**     | **Time** | **Details**                                 |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `addProduct()`    | O(1)     | Insert item into `HashMap` using product ID |
| `updateProduct()` | O(1)     | Retrieve and modify values                  |
| `deleteProduct()` | O(1)     | Remove item using key                       |
| `getProduct()`    | O(1)     | Fetch product by ID instantly               |

###  Edge Considerations:

* **Hash collisions** can degrade performance to O(n) in worst-case scenarios.
* Resizing (`rehashing`) occurs when the load factor threshold is crossed, causing a temporary slowdown.

##  4. Optimization Strategies

### For Small to Medium In-Memory Systems:

1. **Tune `HashMap` for Expected Load**:

   ```java
   new HashMap<>(expectedSize * 2, 0.85f);
   ```

   * Set initial capacity to double the expected number of products
   * A higher load factor saves memory but increases collision risk

2. **Add Secondary Indexes**:

   * Example:

     ```java
     Map<String, List<Product>> categoryIndex = new HashMap<>();
     ```
   * Enables quick filtering by category, brand, etc.

3. **Use Caching**:

   * Implement an **LRU cache** for frequently accessed items
   * Helps reduce computation for popular queries

---

### For Large-Scale (>1M items) Systems:

1. **Integrate a Database**:

   * Use **PostgreSQL** for structured data and complex queries
   * Add indexes on `productId`, `category`, and `stockLevel` for performance

2. **Enable Concurrency**:

   * Use `ConcurrentHashMap` to ensure thread safety
   * Synchronize access to secondary indexes (e.g., category maps)

3. **Batch Operations**:

   * For frequent updates (e.g., stock imports), process data in batches using SQL transactions or job queues
